# DafLeet: Verifying Leetcode Problems in Dafny

Just a project for fun...

All problem solutions starting from `0001` are fully verified in `Dafny 4.3.0.0`.

- [0001: Two Sum](https://github.com/Nangos/dafleet/blob/main/0001-0050/0001-two-sum.dfy)
- [0002: Add Two Numbers](https://github.com/Nangos/dafleet/blob/main/0001-0050/0002-add-two-numbers.dfy)
- [0003: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://github.com/Nangos/dafleet/blob/main/0001-0050/0003-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.dfy)

## What to expect from this repo

I use [Leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) as a "test field" to *play* [Dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny) on. For each problem, I will give a *basic* solution for it, **verified**. I will write detailed comments, where I elaborate my strategy for both solving and verifying the problem. Typically there will also be a *discussion* section where I share what I've learned from the verification process, and perhaps keep on verifying "better-than-basic" solutions if applicable.

These comments are very readable! (Of course, *I assume you are also a fan of Dafny; at least you know the syntax.*)

## DIY Mode

If you want to try solving the problems by yourself, go to [`DIY` branch](https://github.com/Nangos/dafleet/tree/DIY).
There I have removed all implementation and verification code, leaving only the *specifications*.
